# Tractor-Power-Transmission
Simulation of a John Deere engine, transmission, and power flows through the tractor

This was a engineering project that I completed that aimed to simulate a tractor powertrain and engine system.

For a summary of the system, look at the report. The Simulink code is also available for viewing.
